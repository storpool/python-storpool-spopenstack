Description
===========

This package contains Python helper classes to let the StorPool drivers in
OpenStack use the StorPool API in a common way.

StorPool is distributed data storage software running on standard x86 servers.
StorPool aggregates the performance and capacity of all drives into a shared
pool of storage distributed among the servers.  Within this storage pool the
user creates thin-provisioned volumes that are exposed to the clients as block
devices.  StorPool consists of two parts wrapped in one package - a server and
a client.  The StorPool server allows a hypervisor to act as a storage node,
while the StorPool client allows a hypervisor node to access the storage pool
and act as a compute node.  In OpenStack terms the StorPool solution allows
each hypervisor node to be both a storage and a compute node simultaneously.

Version history
===============

3.1.0
-----

- Reraise unexpected StorPool API errors instead of ignoring them
- Handle the StorPool API returning a "busy" error code instead of
  the "invalidParam" one previously
- Fix attempting to lock a file for the second time after the first one
  was unsuccessful
- Use file locking, not a separate lockfile; the attachment JSON file
  must now exist, but it is usually created as part of setting up
  the Cinder and Nova group membership anyway
- Add the year 2021 to the copyright notices
- Reformat the source using version 21 of the black tool
- Disable some more pylint diagnostics because of Python 2 compatibility

3.0.1
-----

- Really implement the "do not detach unrecognized StorPool volumes" bugfix
  from version 3.0.0; the solution there was incomplete
- Recognize the fact that an AttachDB object is never ever instantiated
  without a logger and make the logger parameter non-optional
- Add type hints and fix some minor type mismatches found by the mypy tool
- Refactor the tests for the AttachDB.sync() method
- Apply some minor style improvements

3.0.0
-----

- INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: do not detach unrecognized StorPool volumes when
  the SPAttachDB.sync() method is invoked to allow for OpenStack services
  running in different containers on the same physical host
- do not use external mock and pathlib libraries for the Python 3.x tests


2.2.1
-----

- do not pass a Unicode string argument as a port "number" to the StorPool
  API bindings object
- use the storpool.spapi.Api.fromConfig() method and consequently bump
  the dependency on the "storpool" module to version 4.0.0 or above


2.2.0
-----

- add unit tests
- reformat the source code using black
- fix some flake8 and pylint nits
- support Python 3

2.1.1
-----

- do not detach volumes with names that do not start with our prefix!
- do not treat snapshot attachment requests as stale
- do not wait quite that long before force-detaching a volume

2.1.0
-----

- add the remove_keys() method to the SPLockedJSONDB class
- remove stale requests from our openstack-attach.json cache file

2.0.0
-----

- instead of raising the AttachmentInUse exception, forcibly detach
  the volume on the last attempt
- remove the now unused AttachmentInUse exception

1.0.3
-----

- ignore nonexistent request IDs upon detaching
- allow the default "os" name prefix for volumes created by the OpenStack tools
  to be overridden by the storpool.conf file's new SP_OPENSTACK_VOLUME_PREFIX
  setting
- raise a specific exception when a volume is still in use and may not be
  detached so that the Nova attachment driver may raise a specific exception in
  its turn

1.0.2
-----

- drop the dependency on oslo_concurrency in setup.py, too

1.0.1
-----

- use our own locking instead of oslo_concurrency, making it much easier
  (or even at all possible) to work with OpenStack Juno
- wait for all consumers of the attached StorPool volume to release it when
  detaching it
- wait a bit longer for a newly-attached volume to appear
- only retry locking on a "file exists" error; any other errors are fatal

1.0.0
-----

- first public release
